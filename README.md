# Linked-List-Implementation
The linked list is a sequential representation of elements. Each element of the linked list is called a ‘Node’. One type of linked list is called “Singly linked list”.

In this, each node contains a data part that stores actual data and a second part that stores pointer to the next node in the list.
We have already learned the details of the singly linked list in our previous tutorial.
